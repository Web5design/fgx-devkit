========

This repsitory is intended as a master project, that contains all others.

It mainly contains meta data and a load of git submodules.

The target audience is developers and a toolkit to assemble project from different parts..

Its as usual WIP, and experimental ;-)))

TODO:
	git submodules
	
Wish List

The idea in pete's head is to check out this repos ..
anywhere..

on a client, I want to checkout the marblemap, or the launcher

and many other reasons..

but an idea.....
