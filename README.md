========

This repository is intended as a kinda "master" project, that contains all others.

It mainly contains meta data and a load of git submodules.

But also a GUi for devs, and meta data in etc/

The target audience is developers and a toolkit to assemble project from different parts..

Its as usual WIP, and experimental ;-)))

TODO:
	git submodules
	
Wish List

The idea in pete's head is to check out this repos ..
anywhere..

eg on a server, I want to checkout the mapview, and the ajax server

on a client, I want to checkout the marblemap, or the launcher

and many other reasons..

but an idea.....

Also please others.. make it up as we go along ;-)))
Nothing is precious here.. ;-)
